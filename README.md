# PaySense v2

An AI-driven decision support system that helps Malaysian university students make informed Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) purchasing decisions — by forecasting their financial health and classifying the risk of a proposed BNPL purchase before they commit.

**Status:** scaffolded 2026-10-08 — no application code yet. See [`refdocs/STATUS.md`](refdocs/STATUS.md).

Final Year Project, BSc (Hons) Computer Science, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS — Nur Farah Binti Ahmad Nazri. Supervisor: Dr. Nazleeni Samiha Bt Haron.

## What it does

- **Financial health forecasting.** Places the student's known income, bills and BNPL instalments on their exact dates, forecasts only their discretionary spending, and simulates 1,000 possible futures to show the projected balance with a P10–P90 band and the probability of running short on any due date.
- **BNPL risk classification.** Before a purchase, scores the probability that the student will not be able to pay an instalment in full — Safe / Caution / At Risk — using a calibrated classifier trained on simulated shortfall outcomes for a synthetic population of Malaysian students.
- **Explanations.** The top reasons behind every score (SHAP) and the smallest change that would make the purchase Safe — fewer instalments, waiting until after the next allowance, a lower price, another provider.
- **BNPL across providers.** SPayLater, TikTok PayLater, Atome and any other provider (entered manually) in one place, with provider-accurate schedules for the three named providers, the total monthly commitment, a due-date timeline and reminders.
- **Ledger.** Manual entry and CSV import with preview, recurring income and bills, a running balance.

## Requirements

- Python (version pinned in `backend/.python-version` during P0) managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js 20+ (developed on 24)
- A Supabase project (free tier, Singapore region)

## Setup

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd backend
cp .env.example .env      # fill in — see refdocs/guides/env_setup.md
uv sync
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
```

Apply the SQL files in `backend/migrations/` to your Supabase project in order, then seed a user:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python scripts/seed_users.py --username demo --display "Demo" --persona budget_conscious
```

## Usage

```bash
# terminal 1
cd backend && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
# terminal 2
cd frontend && npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000 → log in with the seeded username
```

(The commands above are created in phase P0 — they will not work until it is complete.)

## Project layout

Planned layout; replaced by the real tree once P0 lands.
