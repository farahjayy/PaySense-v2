# PaySense v2 — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> PaySense is an AI-driven decision support system that helps Malaysian university students make informed Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) purchasing decisions. It integrates **financial health forecasting** (projecting the student's balance day by day with uncertainty, from their own transaction history, known income, bills and existing BNPL instalments) with **BNPL risk classification** (scoring a proposed purchase, before commitment, by the probability that the student cannot pay an instalment in full on its due date), and explains every result in plain language with what would make it safe. v2 is the final FYP product; v1 (`../PaySense/`) was the experiment it learns from.

- **Owner:** Nur Farah Binti Ahmad Nazri (UTP, BSc Computer Science — FYP2). Supervisor: Dr. Nazleeni Samiha Bt Haron.
- **Users:** Malaysian university students who hold a bank (debit/savings) account and e-wallets but typically **no credit card** — BNPL is their main form of credit. In the evaluation build: 5–7 UAT testers on pre-seeded usernames, across 3 personas.
- **Status:** Scaffolded 2026-10-08 — pre-implementation
- **Last updated:** 2026-10-08
- **Source of record:** [paysense-v2-sources.md](paysense-v2-sources.md)
- **Founding context:** [context/v1-lessons.md](context/v1-lessons.md) · [context/research-2026-10-08.md](context/research-2026-10-08.md) · [context/academic-constraints.md](context/academic-constraints.md) · [context/bnpl-billing-rules-my.md](context/bnpl-billing-rules-my.md)

## 1. Context & Hard Constraints

Confirmed from the founding context documents and the scaffold interview (2026-10-08).

| Constraint | Value | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Public repository | v2 is a **public** GitHub repo from its first commit (examiners and advisors read it) | No real personal financial data, no secrets, ever. Real data lives only in gitignored `data/private/`. |
| Candidate algorithms | Fixed by the FYP literature review: ARIMA / Prophet / LSTM; Random Forest / XGBoost / LightGBM; SHAP | No new candidate algorithms. Benchmarks and model *configurations* are allowed with a methodology citation (D-05). |
| Login | Pre-seeded usernames, no passwords, no sign-up (supervisor decision) | Username-only session login; every row is user-scoped (D-03). |
| Input methods | CSV import + manual entry. PDF parsing and bank integration out of scope (supervisor) | Import path must be excellent; persona CSVs are first-class fixtures. |
| Minimum history | 4 months of transactions before forecast and risk unlock (supervisor) | Explicit locked state in the UI below the threshold — never a degraded fake forecast. |
| No fabricated outputs | Even the contingency path pipes real model outputs from verified data, never invented values (supervisor) | Every number on screen traces to a model, a simulation or the user's data. |
| Hosting | Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend) + Supabase Postgres (supervisor plan) | Backend must fit Render's memory; measure it (D-15). |
| Terminology | "financial health forecasting" and "BNPL risk classification" (supervisor) | Used consistently in UI text, docs and reports. |
| Privacy | PDPA 2024 amendment; synthetic personas by default; Supabase Singapore = cross-border transfer | Derived features only to any third-party API; consent text in the UAT kit. |
| Tooling environment | Windows 11 dev machine; Python 3.14 installed system-wide; Node 24; `uv` and `gh` not yet installed | P0 installs uv and pins a Python version every dependency supports (D-23). |

## 2. Product Principles

1. **Show the consequence, not a warning.** The decisive screen is *your* projected balance with and without this purchase. Generic disclosures don't change behaviour (research §D).
2. **Place what is known, forecast only what isn't.** Income, bills and instalments have dates and amounts — they are placed exactly. Only discretionary spending is forecast.
3. **Uncertainty is part of the answer.** Bands and probabilities, never one confident line.
4. **Every score explains itself and says what would make it safe.**
5. **The label must not be the author's opinion.** Engine 2 learns from a forward cash-flow simulation, not from a hand-written formula (v1's core failure).
6. **One definition per quantity.** A feature is computed by one function, used by data generation, training and serving alike.
7. **Honest evaluation.** Benchmarks always included; repeated, rolling, statistically tested; results reported even when unflattering.
8. **Traffic-light first, number second, chart third** for every risk output.

```

**Why sequential (the dissertation's architecture argument):** the risk of a BNPL purchase is a property of the *future* — whether each instalment lands on a day the balance can absorb it. Historical aggregates cannot see an allowance arriving two days after a due date, a bill colliding with an instalment, or a stack of plans from different providers. The forecast is therefore not one input among many: it **generates the training label** (simulated shortfall) and supplies the forward-looking features. The ablation in P5 measures exactly how much it contributes.

### 3.1 Components

**Financial health forecasting (Engine 1) — decided design**

| Step | Definition |
|---|---|
| Known flows | Confirmed recurring income (allowance, PTPTN disbursements, part-time pay), confirmed recurring bills, every unpaid BNPL instalment, future-dated savings goals. Placed on their exact dates. Recurring items are *suggested* by a detection heuristic (merchant normalisation → dominant gap 7/14/28–31 days → amount within ±15% → ≥3 occurrences) and *confirmed* by the user. |
| Discretionary series | Weekly (Mon–Sun) sum of expense transactions not linked to a recurring item or BNPL plan and not of type `savings`. The current, incomplete week is excluded. |
| Forecast | Served model (P3 winner) forecasts weekly discretionary spend for the horizon: 13 weeks on the dashboard; through the last due date of the plan under evaluation for a risk check, capped at 52 weeks. |
| Uncertainty | Residual bootstrap: each path resamples the served model's rolling-origin forecast errors (moving-block bootstrap, block = 4 weeks), the same method for every candidate so the comparison is fair. 1,000 paths. |
| Daily balance | Start = today's ledger balance. Each path adds known flows on their dates and spreads each week's discretionary spend across days using the user's day-of-week spending profile (uniform if history < 8 weeks). |
| Outputs | Daily P10/P50/P90 balance; lowest-balance distribution; **P(shortfall)** = share of paths where the balance after any instalment due date in the horizon is < RM0; the date of the most likely shortfall. |
| Health score (dashboard) | `round((1 − P(shortfall over next 13 weeks, no new purchase)) × 100)`, same Safe/Caution/At Risk bands as Engine 2. |
| Gate | Fewer than 4 months of history → locked state with an import prompt (supervisor constraint). |

**BNPL risk classification (Engine 2) — decided design**

| Element | Definition |
|---|---|
| Target | `p_shortfall_with`: Engine 1's simulated probability that, **with the proposed plan added**, the balance after any instalment due date (existing or proposed) within the plan's horizon falls below RM0. Precedent: Bijak, Thomas & Mues (dynamic affordability); BNM household financial-margin stress test; CCA 2025 affordability duty. |
| Training data | ~10,000 synthetic student profiles from `ml/datagen` (transaction-level histories + existing plans + one proposed purchase each), every one run through the *served* Engine 1 to produce its label — so training and serving see the same forecaster. |
| Soft labels | Trained as probabilistic classifiers on soft targets by duplicate-and-weight: each profile appears once as class 1 with weight p and once as class 0 with weight 1 − p. Works identically for all four models. |
| Features | Defined only in `engines/risk/features.py` (§3.2 table). Age and employment status are dropped (not needed for affordability; fairness). |
| Candidates | Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM — all with **monotonic constraints** on the features whose direction is known — plus a logistic-regression benchmark. |
| Selection | 5×5 repeated stratified CV (strata = p_shortfall deciles), grouped by profile; hyperparameters tuned in an inner loop (Optuna, budget recorded). Primary metric: Brier score against the soft target. Secondary: log-loss, ROC-AUC at p ≥ 0.30, calibration slope and ECE. Pairwise Nadeau–Bengio corrected resampled t-tests (port of v1's harness). |
| Calibration | None / Platt / isotonic chosen by nested CV (port of v1's procedure). |
| Proof of the link | **Ablation:** retrain the winner without the Engine-1-derived features; report ΔBrier with its CI. **Stress test:** income −20% and a delayed PTPTN disbursement. |
| Bands | Safe: p < 0.10 · Caution: 0.10 ≤ p < 0.30 · At Risk: p ≥ 0.30. Pre-registered before training — not tuned on results. Score shown = `round((1 − p) × 100)`. |
| Explanation | SHAP (TreeSHAP for the tree models; exact contributions for the logistic benchmark), top positive factors ≥ 0.02, mapped to plain-language templates whose numbers are checked against the feature values. "Nothing stands out" is allowed. |
| Counterfactuals | "What would make this Safe": re-run the full pipeline over actionable levers — fewer/more instalments the provider offers, first payment after the next income date, a lower price (−10/−25/−50%), another provider — and show the smallest change that reaches Safe. Concept cited to DiCE / Ustun et al.; implemented as an exact grid search. |
| Repayment history | **Not a model feature.** Shown as a separate rule-based flag: overdue instalments in the last 6 months, with BNM's 3-consecutive-misses suspension rule cited. Keeps v1's synthetic-missed-payments distortion out of the model (D-11). |
| Displayed vs simulated | The UI shows the model's calibrated p; the balance chart shows the simulation bands. Their difference is logged per check for the evaluation chapter. |

### 3.2 Data & state

**Postgres tables** (every table except `users` carries `user_id uuid not null references users(id) on delete cascade`):

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | `id`, `username` (unique, case-insensitive), `display_name`, `persona` (`frequent_bnpl` / `budget_conscious` / `irregular_income` / null), `created_at`. Seeded by an admin script; no sign-up endpoint. |
| `user_settings` | `current_balance`, `balance_synced_at`, `ledger_mode` (default **true**), onboarding state. |
| `transactions` | v1 shape (`date`, `amount` > 0, `type` income/expense/savings, `category`, `description`, `account_name`, `is_bnpl`, `source` manual/csv/seed) + `bnpl_plan_id`, `recurring_item_id`. |
| `recurring_items` | `kind` income/bill, `name`, `amount`, `cadence` weekly/biweekly/monthly/semester/custom, `anchor_date`, `active`, `origin` detected/manual. |
| `bnpl_plans`, `bnpl_installments` | v1 shape (provider, price, monthly fee rate, instalments, first payment date, status, paid flags) + `risk_check_id`, `risk_check_type`. |
| `provider_limits` | Optional per-user credit limit per provider (v1 lesson: purchases above the limit are impossible). |
| `risk_checks` | `input`, `features` (+ `feature_schema_hash`), `model_version`, `p`, `p_simulated`, `label`, `factors`, `counterfactuals`, `curves` — frozen for the per-plan risk report. |

**Engine 2 feature set** (exact definitions live in `features.py`; this is the contract):

| Feature | Source | Monotone direction |
|---|---|---|
| `disc_weekly_p50` — mean forecast weekly discretionary spend over the plan horizon (P50) | Engine 1 | ↑ risk |
| `disc_weekly_p90` — mean P90 weekly discretionary spend over the horizon | Engine 1 | ↑ |
| `disc_volatility` — std of the served model's weekly forecast residuals | Engine 1 | ↑ |
| `min_balance_p10_without` — lowest P10 daily balance over the horizon, without the purchase (RM) | Engine 1 | ↓ |
| `income_to_due_gap_days` — median days from the latest expected income before each proposed due date to that due date | Engine 1 known flows | ↑ |
| `instalment_amount` | Plan | ↑ |
| `num_instalments` | Plan | none |
| `monthly_fee_rate` | Plan | ↑ |
| `instalment_to_income` — proposed instalment / expected monthly income | Plan + known flows | ↑ |
| `dsr_with_purchase` — (all monthly BNPL obligations incl. the new plan + monthly debt-like bills) / expected monthly income | Commitments | ↑ |
| `active_plans_with_purchase` | Commitments | ↑ |
| `bnpl_outstanding_to_income` — total unpaid BNPL incl. the purchase (excluding any part paid at checkout) / monthly income | Commitments | ↑ |
| `balance_to_monthly_essentials` — current balance / mean monthly (bills + discretionary) | Liquidity | ↓ |

Features may be added or removed only through an ADR; changing one changes `feature_schema_hash`, which forces regenerating the dataset and retraining (§3, invariant 1).

**Model artefacts:** `backend/models/<engine>/<version>/` with the model file(s), `metadata.json` (training data version, feature list + hash, library versions, metrics, CV summary, calibration choice, git commit). The server refuses to start if the served artefact's feature hash differs from `features.py`.

## 4. Modules / Feature Areas

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Auth & users** | Username-only login, session token, user scoping, admin seeding script for tester accounts. |
| **Ledger** | Transactions CRUD, Income / Expense / Savings, running-ledger balance (balance sync = correction), categories with word-boundary matching. |
| **Import** | CSV upload → column mapping → preview with per-row edits and skip reasons → confirm. Persona CSVs and a generic bank-CSV mapping. |
| **Recurring items** | Detection suggestions from history, user confirmation, manual add/edit; the backbone of known flows. |
| **BNPL plans** | Provider-aware schedules (v1 port: sen maths, monthly fee rate, Atome checkout payment), mark paid (single and bulk), rename, delete-with-transactions, By month bills, provider limits, due-date reminders in-app. Providers (D-24): only **SPayLater, TikTok PayLater and Atome** are named and rule-driven (rules confirmed from real users' checkouts). Any other provider uses **"Other provider (manual)"**: the user types a provider name, first payment date, number of instalments and the instalment amount (or total payable) shown at checkout; the app splits the total exactly in sen and applies no fee formula or provider rule. |
| **Financial health forecasting** | Engine 1 as §3.1. |
| **BNPL risk classification** | Engine 2 as §3.1, risk check → confirm into a plan → frozen risk report. |
| **Dashboard** | Balance, month summary, health gauge, 13-week balance band chart, BNPL stack (total monthly commitment across providers + due-date timeline), upcoming alerts, locked state below 4 months. |
| **Data generation** (`ml/datagen`) | Synthetic Malaysian-student population with documented, cited parameters; persona CSVs for UAT. |
| **Evaluation harnesses** (`ml/`) | Engine 1 comparison, Engine 2 training/selection, report-ready tables and figures in `reports/`. |
| **Model card / About** | In-app page: how the scores are made, data, limitations — for testers and examiners. |
| **UAT kit** | Tester seeding, persona CSVs, task script, SUS + explanation-clarity + pre/post decision vignettes, consent text, analysis script. |

## 5. Non-Goals

Explicitly out of scope. Revisit only by adding an ADR that says why.

- PDF bank-statement parsing (supervisor decision; cite conversion tools instead).
- Bank / open-banking / e-wallet API integration.
- Passwords, sign-up, OAuth, password reset (supervisor decision: username-only).
- New candidate algorithms outside the literature review — ETS, foundation models (Chronos, TimesFM, Moirai), EBM. Recorded as future work in the sources doc.
- Native mobile apps (the web app must work well on a phone browser).
- Push/SMS/email notifications (in-app reminders only).
- CCRIS/CTOS credit bureau integration.
- Investment tracking, peer comparison, social features.
- Using any tester's real financial data.

## 6. Build Roadmap

Phases are a dependency order only — no dates (author's instruction). Frontend screens for a module may be built as soon as that module's backend phase is green.

| Phase | Scope | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 Foundation** | Monorepo skeleton (`backend/` uv project, `frontend/` Next.js), Ruff/pytest/Vitest/ESLint, Supabase project + migrations, username login + user-scoped repository layer, OpenAPI → TS client generation, dependency & memory spike for the full ML stack | Both apps boot; login works for two seeded users and each sees only their own rows (test); generated client compiles; spike report records which Python version installs every dependency and the backend's resident memory |
| **P1 Ledger & BNPL domain** | Port v1 domain modules + tests (schedule, providers, ledger, plans, bills, categorize), transactions/plans/balance/providers APIs, CSV import, recurring items (manual), provider limits | Ported v1 tests green; API round-trips for every endpoint; multi-user isolation tests pass |
| **P2 Synthetic population** | `ml/datagen`: cited parameter file, transaction-level generator, 3 persona CSVs (4 months each), Engine 2 profile set, Engine 1 cohort | Generator deterministic under a seed; distribution report vs cited targets; persona CSVs import cleanly through P1's importer |
| **P3 Engine 1 evaluation** | Datasets (MoneyData, Berka subsample, synthetic cohort, optional private log), candidates (Naive, Moving average, AutoARIMA, Prophet, global LSTM), rolling-origin harness, MASE/RMSSE/coverage/balance-MAE, HLN-DM + Wilcoxon + Friedman/Nemenyi | `reports/engine1/` tables + figures; winner chosen by the D-06 rule; decision recorded as an ADR |
| **P4 Engine 1 serving** | Recurring detection, discretionary series, served model, residual bootstrap, daily Monte Carlo, `/api/forecast`, health score | Designed-case tests (salary day, bill collision, stacked instalments) pass; forecast latency measured; 4-month gate enforced |
| **P5 Engine 2 training** | Simulation labels via served Engine 1, shared `features.py`, 4 candidates with monotone constraints, Optuna tuning, 5×5 CV, calibration, ablation, stress tests, artefacts + metadata | `reports/engine2/` tables + figures; winner + calibration ADR; ablation shows the Engine 1 contribution with a CI |
| **P6 Engine 2 serving** | `/api/risk/check` (with/without simulation, features, model, SHAP, counterfactuals, repayment flag), confirm → plan, frozen risk report | Designed cases from academic-constraints §5 pass; feature-hash guard tested; p vs p_simulated logged |
| **P7 Frontend** | All screens on the v1 design system: login, onboarding/import, dashboard, transactions, recurring, plans, risk checker, risk report, model card | Every screen has loading/empty/error/locked states; 375/768/1440 layouts; Playwright covers login → import → forecast → risk check → confirm |
| **P8 Deployment** | Vercel + Render + Supabase Singapore, env-driven URLs and CORS, keep-alive plan, functional-test checklist on the live URL | Fresh-session walkthrough on the live URL incl. a phone browser; memory within the host limit |
| **P9 UAT kit** | Tester seeding script, persona assignment, task script, SUS + explanation clarity + pre/post vignettes, short participant information note (synthetic data only), analysis script | Dry run with one tester; analysis script produces SUS mean + CI and the decision-switch table from the dry-run data |
| **P10 Optional** | LLM-phrased explanations from SHAP JSON with number check + template fallback; dissertation figure pack | Only after P0–P9 are green |

## 7. Decision Log

Canonical one-line list. Load-bearing entries are expanded as ADRs in `changelog/DECISIONS.md` under the same id.

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D-01 | v2 is a new public repo; v1 is a frozen reference; proven v1 modules are ported with their tests | v1 was the experiment; its domain code is correct and tested, its engines are not reused |
| D-02 | Stack: Next.js (App Router, TS, Tailwind 4, Recharts) + FastAPI + Supabase Postgres; add uv, Ruff, TanStack Query, zod, Vitest, Playwright | Continuity with v1 and the concept document; additions fix v1's untested frontend and hand-mirrored types |
| D-03 | Username-only login issuing a signed bearer token; every query user-scoped in the repository layer; backend-only DB access, RLS on with no anon policies | Supervisor decision; bearer token avoids cross-site cookie issues between Vercel and Render |
| D-04 | Engine 1 = component forecaster: known flows placed, discretionary weekly spend forecast, residual-bootstrap Monte Carlo, anchored to today | v1's single net series lost to naive baselines, decayed to zero and had no uncertainty |
| D-05 | Candidates stay within the literature review (ARIMA/Prophet/LSTM; RF/XGB/LGBM; SHAP); only benchmarks (naive, moving average, logistic regression) and configurations (global LSTM, monotonic constraints, counterfactual search) are added | Methodology must follow from the reviewed literature; the real fixes are design, not algorithms |
| D-06 | Engine 1 selection: rolling-origin, pooled MASE primary; the served model is the best literature candidate unless it is significantly worse than the best benchmark, in which case the benchmark is served and that is reported as a finding | Honest selection; Objective 1 still names the best literature model |
| D-07 | Engine 2 target = simulated shortfall probability from Engine 1 (balance < RM0 after any due date in the horizon) | Defensible, cited, and makes the forecast → classifier link load-bearing |
| D-08 | One synthetic population generator feeds Engine 2 training, the Engine 1 cohort and the UAT persona CSVs; parameters cited in a single file | One set of assumptions to justify; supervisor's top methodology concern |
| D-09 | Engine 2 features defined once in `engines/risk/features.py`; artefacts carry a feature-schema hash checked at startup | v1's train/serve mismatches |
| D-10 | Engine 2 trained on soft labels (duplicate-and-weight); 5×5 repeated CV grouped by profile; Optuna tuning; Brier primary; corrected t-tests; nested-CV calibration | Rigour the supervisor asked for; reuses v1's proven harness |
| D-11 | Repayment history is a rule-based flag, not a model feature | Synthetic missed-payment behaviour distorted v1; BNM's 3-miss rule is citable as-is |
| D-12 | Explanations: SHAP top factors (≥ 0.02) with number-checked templates + exact grid counterfactuals over actionable levers | Literature-reviewed XAI + actionable recourse |
| D-13 | Input = CSV import + manual entry; PDF parsing out of scope | Supervisor decision |
| D-14 | No real personal data in the repo; private data only in gitignored `data/private/` | Public repo |
| D-15 | Hosting Vercel + Render + Supabase Singapore; if the served stack exceeds Render's memory, fall back to Google Cloud Run (1 GiB) and/or serve LSTM via ONNX Runtime | Supervisor plan, with a measured escape hatch |
| D-16 | All money arithmetic in integer sen | v1 lesson, pinned by tests |
| D-17 | Provider rules served by `GET /api/providers`; the frontend never mirrors them | Removes v1's hand-sync invariant |
| D-18 | TS API types generated from FastAPI's OpenAPI (`openapi-typescript` + `openapi-fetch`); drift fails the check | Removes v1's hand-mirrored `types.ts` |
| D-19 | Running-ledger balance by default; balance sync is a correction tool | v1's manual-sync balance went stale |
| D-20 | Risk bands pre-registered: Safe < 0.10, Caution 0.10–0.30, At Risk ≥ 0.30 on P(shortfall) | Bands must not be tuned on results |
| D-21 | Shortfall threshold is RM0 (cannot pay the instalment in full); a RM50 buffer is a UI warning only | Objective, provider-meaningful definition |
| D-22 | TDD, 80% coverage target, conventional commits; Claude commits at verified phase ends, never pushes | Author's standing rules; pushes are done by the author |
| D-23 | Python version pinned via uv to one every ML dependency installs on (expected 3.12; verified in P0) | Prophet, PyTorch, LightGBM, SHAP wheels on Windows and Render |
| D-24 | Only SPayLater, TikTok PayLater and Atome are named providers with schedule rules; every other provider uses a manual "Other provider" entry (user types dates and the checkout instalment amount) | Only these three have rules confirmed from real users; a guessed first due date creates phantom missed payments, and a flat monthly fee rate can't represent other providers' fees (v1 lesson) |
| D-25 | Berka is used only as a real-transaction benchmark for Engine 1 (and to pre-train the global LSTM), never as a model of the target population | Czech adult accounts from the 1990s; the student population is represented by the cited synthetic generator |

---

## 8. Open Questions

Unresolved. Anything marked `ASSUMED:` is a working assumption, not a confirmed fact — it must be confirmed before anything load-bearing is built on it.

1. `ASSUMED:` Python 3.12 installs every dependency (Prophet/cmdstan, PyTorch, LightGBM, XGBoost, SHAP, statsforecast) on Windows and Render. P0 spike confirms or picks another version.
2. `ASSUMED:` The full served stack fits Render's 512 MB; if not, D-15's fallback applies. P0 spike measures it.
3. `ASSUMED:` The Berka dataset can be obtained as CSV without a paid account (author approved its use as a benchmark, D-25). If not, Engine 1's multi-series benchmark is MoneyData + synthetic cohort only, and the global LSTM trains on the synthetic cohort.
4. `ASSUMED:` Horizon cap of 52 weeks for risk checks; plans longer than 12 months are scored on their first year with a visible note.
5. `ASSUMED:` Synthetic population size ~10,000 profiles is enough for stable 5×5 CV; P5 checks learning curves.
6. Providers other than SPayLater, TikTok PayLater and Atome are not named in the app until the author collects a real checkout example for each; until then they use the manual "Other provider" entry (D-24).
7. Whether the supervisor and faculty consultants want to review the simulation-derived label design before P5 training starts (recommended).

UAT ethics/consent approval: not required (author, 2026-10-08) — testers use synthetic persona data only.

## 9. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Engine 1 | Code name for financial health forecasting. Not used in user-facing text or the dissertation. |
| Engine 2 | Code name for BNPL risk classification. Same rule. |
| Known flows | Income, bills and instalments with known dates and amounts — placed, not forecast. |
| Discretionary spend | Expenses not tied to a recurring item or BNPL plan; the only forecast quantity. |
| Shortfall | The balance after an instalment due date is below RM0 in a simulated path. |
| P(shortfall) | Share of the 1,000 Monte Carlo paths with a shortfall within the horizon. |
| MASE | Mean Absolute Scaled Error — forecast error relative to the in-sample naive forecast; < 1 beats naive. |
| Brier score | Mean squared error between predicted probability and target; lower is better. |
| Soft label | A probability used as the training target instead of 0/1. |
| Persona | One of three UAT tester profiles: frequent BNPL, budget-conscious, irregular income. |
| Sen | 1/100 of a ringgit; all money maths is in integer sen. |
| DSR | Debt service ratio — monthly debt obligations / monthly income. |
